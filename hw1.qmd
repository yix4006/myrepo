## **Figure 1**

Make a scatter plot showing the milk production in pounds versus the average number of milk cows using `milkcow_facts`. Write a caption for this plot.

-   The x-axis will be the number of milk cows (in millions) and the y-axis will be milk production (in millions of pounds)

-   Color the plot using a continuous variable of years

-   Label the axes (do not use the variable name)

-   Add a title for the plot

-   Label the legend (do not use the variable name)

    ```{r}
    ggplot(milkcow_facts,aes(
      x=avg_milk_cow_number/1000000,
      y=milk_production_lbs/1000000,
      color=year ))+
      geom_point()+
      labs(x='average number of milk cows(in millions)',
           y='milk production in pounds(in millions of pound)',
           title='Relationship Between Number of Milk Cows and Milk Production')
    ```

Trend: As the number of cows increases, milk production initially increases rapidly, but after reaching a certain number (about 9.25 million) , the production tends to stabilize or even slightly decrease, showing diminishing returns.

Time factor: Later years (light blue) generally produce higher yields for the same number of cows.

Quantity constraints: Yield growth tends to stall when the number of cows exceeds 9.5 to 10 million.

## **Figure 2**

Examine the milk total milk production in each region over time using `state_milk_production`. We will plot line plots for the milk production versus the year faceted by region. Write a caption for this plot.

-   First, find the total production of milk each year by region (hint: use `summarise()` to find this)

-   The x-axis will be time and the y-axis will be total milk produced (in millions of pounds) in the region that year

-   Make line plots and color each line a different color

-   Facet the plot by region

-   Label the axes (do not use the variable name)

-   Add a title for the plot

-   Remove the legend from the plot

```{r}
region_milk_production <- state_milk_production %>%
  group_by(year, region) %>%
  summarise(total_milk = sum(milk_produced, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(state_milk_production,aes(
  x=year,
  y=milk_produced/1000000,
  color=region
))+
  geom_line()+
  labs(
    x='year',
    y='Total Milk Production (in Millions of Pounds',
    title='Total Milk Production by Region Over Time')
  
```

Trends: The Lake States and Pacific were the dominant regions in milk production, with significant increases in milk production, while other regions saw more limited growth and some regions remained stable.

Separate: Lake States (green): This is the region with the highest milk production, which has been steadily increasing since 1970. Especially after 2000, the growth rate accelerated significantly, far outpacing other regions. Pacific (dark blue): Milk production grew very rapidly between 1980 and 2000. Although growth slowed after 2000, milk production in the region remained at a high level, second only to the Lake States. Northeast (light blue): Milk production growth in the region has been relatively flat, but modest compared to the Lake States and the Pacific. Mountain (sky blue): Production continued to rise throughout the period, with a steady growth rate. Corn Belt (yellow): Growth has been relatively slow, with production remaining at relatively steady low levels throughout the time period. Appalachian (red), Delta States (green), Southeast (pink), Southern Plains (purple), Northern Plains (dark gray): Milk production in these regions was generally stable between 1970 and 2015, with less variation and lower yields.

## **Figure 3**

Make a line plot showing the amount (in pounds) of each milk products sold over time using `fluid_milk_sales`. Write a caption for this plot.

-   Do not include the category ??Total Production?? in the plot

-   The x-axis will be time and the y-axis will be pounds of product

-   Each milk product will be a separate line on the plot

-   A different color will be assigned for each milk product

-   Make the plot on the log scale for better visualization

-   Label the axes (do not use the variable name)

-   Add a title for the plot

-   Label the legend (do not use the variable name)

    ```{r}
    filtered_milk_sales <- fluid_milk_sales %>%filter(milk_type!='Total Production')

    ggplot(filtered_milk_sales,aes(
      x=year,
      y=pounds,
      color=milk_type
    ))+
      geom_line()+
      labs(
        x='year',
        y='pounds of product',
        title='Sales of Milk Products Over Time',
        color='milk product'
      )
    ```

Trends: In the overall milk market, sales of whole milk declined significantly, while sales of low-fat and skim milk increased significantly. Specialty categories such as flavored milk have grown but have a smaller market share. There has been no significant change in the sales of buttermilk, eggnog and flavored (Whole) milk.

## **Figure 4**

Make a stacked bar plot of the different type of cheeses consumed over time using a long format version of `clean_cheese` that you create. Write a caption for this plot.

Data wrangling (hint: create a new dataframe called `clean_cheese_long`):

-   Remove all of the total cheese variables (we do not want these in the plot)

-   Change the `clean_cheese` data to long format using `pivot_longer()`

-   Make sure all of the cheese categories are capitalized

Plotting:

-   The x-axis will be time and the y-axis will be pounds of cheese

-   Color the stacked bar plot by the different types of cheese

-   Label the axes (do not use the variable name)

-   Add a title for the plot

-   Change the color of the plot using a palette from RColorBrewer (note that not all palettes will have enough colors for the plot)

    ```{r}
    clean_cheese_long <- clean_cheese %>%
      select(-starts_with("Total")) %>%
      pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = "cheese_type", values_to = "pounds") %>%
      mutate(cheese_type = str_to_title(cheese_type))
    clean_cheese_long
    ggplot(clean_cheese_long,aes(
      x=Year,
      y=pounds,
      fill = cheese_type
    ))+
      geom_bar(stat='identity')+
      labs(
           x='year',
           y='pounds of cheese',
           title='Cheese Consumption Over Time')
    ```

    -   Trend: Overall growth: From 1970 to 2010, the total consumption of cheese rose steadily. This indicates that Americans' demand for cheese continued to increase during this period. Mozzarella and Cheddar dominate: Mozzarella and Cheddar account for a significant share of consumption, with the rapid growth of Mozzarella in particular making it the most popular type of cheese. Slightly decreased Processed Cheese: The growth rate of Processed Cheese has slowed or even slightly decreased compared to other cheese types, indicating a weakening of consumer demand for it. This indicates that during this time, consumers gradually preferred natural cheeses, such as Mozzarella, while the demand for processed cheeses was relatively reduced.

    From this chart, we can see the trends in the consumption of different types of cheese in the United States from 1970 to 2010. Here are the consumption trends and relationships for each type of cheese: 1. Mozzarella (turquoise) : The increase was most significant, with consumption of Mozzarella increasing substantially from 1970 to 2010. This shows that it is becoming more and more popular with consumers, especially after 1980. 2. Cheddar (light brown) : Cheddar consumption has been on a steady upward trend since 1970, and while not as significant as Mozzarella, it remains a significant component of overall cheese consumption. 3. Processed Cheese (pink) : Although Processed Cheese was more popular in 1970, its growth leveled off and even declined slightly after 2000, indicating that its popularity may have waned somewhat. 4. Cream And Neufchatel (light green) : During the whole period, the consumption of Cream and Neufchatel increased steadily, but the growth rate was relatively gentle, and the consumption remained at a medium level. 5. Other Dairy Cheese (gray-green) : The consumption of Other Dairy Cheese gradually increased after 1980, although its overall consumption is low, but the growth trend is significant. 6. Swiss, Blue, Muenster, Brick, Italian Other: The consumption of these cheese types is relatively low and the growth is relatively stable, with no significant change in consumption.

    ## **Figure 5**

    Time to be creative! Make an original figure using the data. Join two of the dataframes together and use variables from both sides of the join to make this figure. This figure should tell a story and be easy to understand (just as the figures above are!). Change the colors of this plot from the default ggplot2 colors. Write a caption for this plot.

    ```{r}
    # Merge the two datasets based on year
    merged_data <- milkcow_facts %>%
      inner_join(state_milk_production, by = "year")

    # Create scatter plot for custom figure
    ggplot(merged_data, aes(
      x=avg_milk_cow_number/1000000,
      y=milk_produced/1000000,
      color=region)) +
      geom_point() +
      labs(
        x = "Number of Milk Cows (in Millions)",
        y = "Milk Production (in Millions of Pounds)",
        title = "Relationship Between Number of Milk Cows and Milk Production by Region",
        color = "Region"
      ) 

    ```

This scatter plot shows that the relationship between the number of cows and milk production varies significantly across regions.

Trend: The chart shows that the number of cows varies between 8.5 and 11.0 million, while milk production ranges from less than 10,000 million pounds to 40,000 million pounds. The points in the scatter plot show a layered pattern in the vertical direction, showing that milk production varies significantly across regions, even with the same number of cows.

Separate:1. Lake States (green) : The points in the Lake States are concentrated in areas with higher milk production, especially when the cow population approaches 9.5 to 10.5 million and yields between 20,000 and 40,000 million pounds. 2. Pacific (dark blue) : Milk production is also higher in the Pacific region, especially when cow numbers approach 10.0 to 11.0 million and yields range from 30,000 to 40,000 million pounds. . 3. Northeast (light blue) : Milk production in the Northeast is more evenly distributed, with most points concentrated in the range of 10,000 to 30,000 million pounds. 4. Mountain (light green) : The Mountain region has a wider distribution of points, with milk production ranging from 10,000 to 30,000 million pounds. 5. Other regions (Appalachian, Corn Belt, Delta States, Southern Plains, etc.) : Milk production in these regions is relatively low, with most points concentrated below 10,000 million pounds.
